<p><b>put file action</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>For the <b>put file</b> action run, we need to start the flask app service on the QA file server to activate the listening port. Steps to run the <b>put file</b> action:</li>
  <br>
  <ul>
  <li>Do the SSH into the QA file server VM with valid credentials</li>
  <li>Move to flask_app repo</li>
  <li>Run <b>python cpy.py</b> command to activate the listening port. Make sure service started without any error</li>
  <li>Go to the Phantom instance and run the action with required parameters. We are using the <b>/web_storage</b> directory instead of <b>/malware_samples</b> due to limited permission to store files on the QA file server</li>
</ul>
</ul>
